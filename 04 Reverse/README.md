## Buttons

The file `Main.elm` holds a broken version of the field example.
The idea is that you should be able to fill in the input field.
And then a reversed version of that content should be shown on screen.

*Tip: Documentation about the elm modules are here:*
- Home: http://package.elm-lang.org/ 
- String library: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/String

#### Challenge

* Try to fix the `Main.elm` file
* Make sure that the content is reversed
* Try making the content upper cased as well
* Try adding an additional style element to the input box
* Try adding a clear button, than clears the input field
* Can you also manage to get the clear button working without creating a new Msg action?
* Maybe you have some more idea's to play around with in this file?
