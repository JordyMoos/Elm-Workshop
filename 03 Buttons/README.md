## Buttons

The file `Main.elm` holds a broken version of the buttons example.

*Tip: try using the `elm-reactor`*

*Tip: Documentation about the elm modules are here:*
- Home: http://package.elm-lang.org/ 
- Core library: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest
- Html library: http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/latest

#### Challenge

* Try to fix the `Main.elm` file
* Try to add the Reset button and functionality
* Try adding a `Increment5` which increments the value with 5
* Maybe you have some more idea's to play around with in this file?
